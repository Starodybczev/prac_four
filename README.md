## 📱 Project Description

This application is an **electronic guide about vacuum cleaners**, structured as a book with thematic sections.

Users can:
- browse book sections
- search content
- read articles with **pinch-to-zoom**
- resume reading after app restart
- send feedback to the author
- open an external website

The project fully satisfies the assignment requirements:

- ✔ **Multiple thematic sections**
- ✔ **Navigation between screens**
- ✔ **Search functionality**
- ✔ **Font size change via touch gestures (pinch-to-zoom)**
- ✔ **State persistence (last read section)**
- ✔ **Recovery after screen rotation and app restart**
- ✔ **External website opening**
- ✔ **Email feedback to author**

## ✨ Key Features

- 📚 **Electronic book structure**
- 🔍 **Real-time search by section title**
- 🤏 **Pinch-to-zoom text scaling**
- 💾 **Last read section saved using DataStore**
- 🔁 **Automatic resume reading**
- 🌐 **External website integration**

## 🧱 Architecture

The project follows a **clean, UI-focused architecture**:

- `pages` — application screens
- `features` - features app
- `components` — reusable UI components
- `data` — book content and persistence
- `types` — data models
- `navigation` — routing logic

State is handled using **Compose state** (`remember`, `rememberSaveable`)  
Navigation is implemented with **Jetpack Navigation Compose**.
